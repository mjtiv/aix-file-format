## A Self-Contained, Executable Prompt + Data + Logic Format for LLMs

## 🧠 What Is a `.aix` File?

`.aix` stands for **AI eXecutable** — a novel, plain-text file format designed to **encapsulate prompt logic, data, scoring rules, and executable scripts** into a single, portable, and LLM-friendly document.

It is:

- Human-readable ✅  
- AI-parsable ✅  
- ChatGPT-runnable ✅  
- Cross-compatible with future LLM agent stacks ✅  

This format solves a massive pain point in prompt engineering, data wrangling, and AI logic reusability.

---

## 🔧 Why Does It Matter?

### The Problem:
Prompt engineering has evolved into an **undocumented, fragmented mess**:
- Prompts, scoring rubrics, scripts, and data live in **separate tabs, apps, or memory slots**
- Users can’t easily **replay**, **share**, or **audit** AI workflows
- No native way to say: "Here’s my data + my logic + the prompt structure + the output interface"

### The Solution:
`.aix` combines **all components** of an LLM task into one structured file.

## 🧱 Anatomy of an `.aix` File

Each file is made of **modular section headers** that divide content:

```
=== AIX:Meta ===         # Author, version, intent  
=== AIX:Rules ===        # Scoring rubrics, prompt conventions  
=== AIX:Founders_Prepopulated ===  # Structured JSON data (e.g., tone profiles)  
=== AIX:User_Interface ===          # AI-guided prompt flow  
=== AIX:Python_Script ===           # Executable code block (auto-runs on open)  
=== AIX:End ===          # Logical EOF marker  
```

> 📝 **Note**: Not all sections are required in every `.aix` file.  
> This structure is **flexible and composable** — a file might include only data and script, or just rules and UI flow. Think of it like a modular AI workbook: use only the blocks you need.

## 🚀 Real-World Use Case: **CryptoTone**

An `.aix` file can profile public tech figures by tone:
- Stores their clarity, volatility, and evasiveness
- Assigns archetypes (e.g., “Visionary Builder” or “Iceberg Pretender”)
- Includes a runnable `matplotlib` visualization block
- Can be edited, re-run, or extended inside ChatGPT or a Jupyter environment

Result? One `.aix` file becomes a fully portable tone-profiling engine — **with no external code or app dependency.**

---

## 💬 Example Usage: Running CryptoTone in ChatGPT

### What to do:

Just upload the `.aix` file and say:

> **"Please run this .aix file and generate the tone map using the embedded Python script."**

That’s it. ChatGPT will:
1. Parse all tone profiles  
2. Apply embedded rules (clarity, volatility, evasion)  
3. Generate a labeled tone map plot — no setup or coding required

---

## 🧠 What’s Embedded in the File:
- ✅ Public tone scoring rules (clarity, volatility, evasion)
- ✅ JSON-stored profiles (e.g. SBF, Elon, Trump)
- ✅ Color-coded status mapping (e.g. green = proven, red = collapsed)
- ✅ Python script for auto-plotting tone quadrants
- ✅ A user interface prompt block for adding, comparing, or exporting data

---

## 🔄 Dynamic Updates

You can also ask ChatGPT:

> "Add [Jane Doe] to the tone map. She's a biotech founder who communicates clearly but deflects when asked about risks."

or

> "Remove Adam Neumann."

The `.aix` format contains all the parsing logic and scoring framework — so ChatGPT knows **how to rank, assign archetypes, and place new figures** correctly on the chart.

---

## 🔒 ChatGPT Integration: Hidden Infrastructure Unlocked

When dropped into ChatGPT, an `.aix` file taps directly into GPT-4’s **code interpreter, text parser, and prompt engine** in a clean, seamless way. It effectively uses:

- Code interpreter for Python execution  
- Memory for reasoning over the `Rules` block  
- Prompt flow logic from the `User_Interface` section  
- JSON parsing and re-serialization  

And it does it **without custom APIs, plug-ins, or wrappers**.

---

## 💥 What It Solves

- ✅ No more scattered prompt + script + config + output  
- ✅ Shareable and reproducible AI workflows  
- ✅ Structured yet readable — works for lawyers, scientists, and journalists  
- ✅ Handles evolving tone, personas, case studies, or decision tools  
- ✅ Can be versioned, diffed, Git-tracked  

---

## 🔄 Future Potential

- Pair `.aix` with LangChain, Agentic frameworks, or HuggingFace Transformers  
- Use it as a building block for AI knowledge modules (“AI apps as files”)  
- Plug into `aix-runner` CLI tools or GitHub Copilot IDE integrations  

---

## 💡 Summary

**`.aix` isn’t just a file format — it’s a new cognitive container**.

It gives AI the structure it needs to execute real reasoning tasks, while giving humans a way to package, share, and control complex logic in a single document.

It’s markdown + Jupyter + JSON + executable prompt — all in one.

If you’ve ever struggled with reusing your prompts, embedding scoring logic, or keeping AI systems coherent…  
`.aix` just solved that problem.
