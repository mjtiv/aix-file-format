The `.aix` file format and associated examples are released under the MIT License for **personal, academic, and research use only**.

- Agent trust scoring  
- Drift-based enforcement (e.g., NFER)  
- Quarantine triggers or sandboxing  
- AI agent orchestration using `.aix` capsules  

**may require a separate commercial license**.

This includes incorporation into:
